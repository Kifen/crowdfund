# crowdfund
##### A dapp developed to replicate the services of [kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/).

**CrowdFund** was written to replicate where **kickstarter**, but with some added features. 

### How It Works
- Users can create campaign to raise funds for their projects
- Fellow users can contribute to a campaign
- Once donations have been made to a campaign, manager (i.e creator) of campaign cannot withdraw funds/money from campaign, unless they make request giving the purpose of withdrawal, amount to withdraw and wallet address of person who the item is going to be purchased from or who is going to perform the said service.
- Once request have been made, all contributors to a campaign can view the request, and approve or not approve.
- Funds requested can only be withdrawn from the smart-contract if the percentage of donors to a campaign who approve a request is over 50%
- If the approvals for a request is over 50%, manager of campaign can then withdraw the requested and approved funds - the funds when withdrawn is sent directly to the wallet of the person performing the sevice as indicated in the request form.
